# Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 compliance for internet facing applications 
Deliver Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 compliance and improve end user experience with your internet facing Azure applications and services. The architectures and resources provided guides government organizations towards TIC 3.0 compliance by directly deploying the required assets or show how to incorporate the solution into an existing architecture. End user performance will improve as users will directly access the Azure application or service instead of being routed to a TIC 2.0+ Managed Trusted Internet Protocol Service (MTIPS) device then to Azure.  

The common component for each of the solutions outlined in this article is an Azure Automation account leveraging a Service Principle to collect inbound traffic logs from the firewall and sending those logs to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provisioned Cloud Log Aggregation Warehouse (CLAW).

## Potential use cases

Federal organizations and government agencies are the most likely use case for implementing TIC 3.0 compliance solutions for the Azure applications and services. TIC 3.0 matures data collection from the on-premises only into a cloud forward approach that better supports how modern organization IT is utilized. The CISA CLAW is a maturation of the EINSTEIN on-premises data collection model geared towards cloud environments. CISA wants to "improve performance, reduce costs, and enhance threat discovery and incident  responsiveness for agencies".

### Supported CLAW Destinations

CISA's initial CLAW destination leverages Amazon S3 as the storage mechanism. As such, this solution supports S3. When CISA deploys CLAW support running in Azure, this solution will update to send logs to Azure-based CLAW.

## Architecture

Architecture solutions are defined by three categories: Azure firewall and third-party firewalls. Azure firewall send logs to a Log Analytics workspace using the diagnostic settings configuration native to Azure. Third-party firewalls send logs using the vendors syslog export feature. For the purpose of this guide, the Palo Alto network virtual appliance (NVA), running in Azure, will be used for the tutorial on how to export logs in syslog format to the Log Analytics workspace.

### Alternatives

Instead of using an Automation Account to query Log Analytics workspace, format the data into JSON, and upload it to the S3 bucket, the organization could develop their own Azure Function to perform the same task. This may be useful for an organization with software developers integrated into operations and are more familiar with C# or are heavily utilizing Azure Functions today.

## Considerations

Deciding which architecture and resources to deploy, depends on what architecture the government organization has in place today. The following criteria may assist with deciding which solution to deploy.

### Firewalls

- If the organization wants to test using an Automation account, then deploy the [Complete](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection#complete) solution to a test/dev environment.
- If the organization has an application in Azure that is routed back on-premises and have not deployed a firewall in Azure, then deploy the [Network + Log Analytics + Automation](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection#network--log-analytics--automation-account).
- If the organization has an Azure firewall deployed and are routing the application through the Azure firewall back to on-premises, then deploy the [Log Analytics + Automation account](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection#log-analytics--automation-account).
- If the organization is using a Log Analytics workspace, along with an Azure firewall deployed and are routing the application through the Azure firewall back to on-premises [Automation account only](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection#automation-account-only).

## Deploy this scenario

### Requirements for all solutions

For step by step details visit [Prerequisite tasks](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection/tree/main/Architecture/Prerequisite%20Tasks)

You must have the following before deployment:

- Resource Group.
- Register an Enterprise application.
  - This will be used to provide reader access to Log Analytics workspace (LAW).
- Create Secret for Enterprise application.

Though you can deploy all of the Azure resources, to actually send log data to a CISA CLAW to support the TIC 3.0 compliance you will need the following: 

- Request CISA provide S3 bucket access key, secret, and S3 bucket name.
- Collect Tenant ID.

### Post deployment tasks for all solutions

For step by step details visit [Post deployment](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection/tree/main/Architecture/Post%20Deployment%20Tasks) tasks

The following needs to be performed once deployment is complete. These are the tasks that an ARM template cannot perform and requires some manual effort. 

- Add enterprise application with reader role to Log Analytics workspace (LAW).
- Link schedule to runbook.
- Update Automation account variables with your unique values 
  - CISA provided CLAW S3 access key
  - CISA provided CLAW S3 access secret
  - Unique S3 bucket name
  - Log Analytics workspace ID
  - Tenant ID
  - Enterprise application ID
  - Enterprise application secret

### Upload to CLAW runbook

For more details and to view the runbook visit [UploadToCLAW-S3](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection/blob/main/Runbook/UploadToCLAW-S3.ps1)

The Automation account runs a PowerShell-based Runbook to query the Log Analytics workspace, format the data into a JSON, and stream it to the CLAW. The reason for using stream is to break it down into small chunks to reduce the performance impact of reading large files at once. Reading the data from a 250 mb file before uploading it may cause the process to fail. AWSPowerShell tools are used to connect to the S3 bucket and upload the JSON data into a datatime.json file.

The runbook uses encrypted Automation account variables to simplify initial configuration and ongoing maintenance. Once the organziation deploys the Automation account, the runbook will not need modification. Administrators will perform the initial configuration by updating the values of each variable (See [Prerequisite tasks](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection/tree/main/Architecture/Prerequisite%20Tasks)). When the CLAW S3 secret and enterprise application secret are rotated, the administrators only need to update the appropriate variable. 

#### Alerting

An Azure alert is deployed and configured to send an failure email notification, to the email(s) defined at deployment. The notification informs the organization when the runbook fails. Administrators can dig into the runbook history for more details on why the runbook failed.
