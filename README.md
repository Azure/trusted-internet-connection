# Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 compliance for internet facing applications 
Deliver Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 compliance and improve end user experience with your internet facing Azure applications and services. The architectures and resources provided guides government organizations towards TIC 3.0 compliance by directly deploying the required assets or show how to incorporate the solution into an existing architecture. End user performance will improve as users will directly access the Azure application or service instead of being routed to a TIC 2.0+ Managed Trusted Internet Protocol Service (MTIPS) device then to Azure.  

The common component for each of the solutions outlined in this article is an Azure Automation account leveraging a Service Principle to collect inbound traffic logs from the firewall and sending those logs to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provisioned Cloud Log Aggregation Warehouse (CLAW).

## Potential use cases

Federal organizations and government agencies are the most likely use case for implementing TIC 3.0 compliance solutions for their web applications and API services deployed in Azure. TIC 3.0 matures data collection from the on-premises only into a cloud forward approach that better supports how modern organization IT is utilized. The CISA CLAW is a maturation of the EINSTEIN on-premises data collection model geared towards cloud environments. CISA aims to "improve performance, reduce costs, and enhance threat discovery and incident  responsiveness for agencies".

*Microsoft provides this information to Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) departments and agencies as part of a suggested configuration to facilitate participation in CISAâ€™s CLAW capability. This suggested configuration is maintained by Microsoft and is subject to change.*

### Supported CLAW Destinations

As of Q1 2022, CISA's CLAW only resides in an Amazon S3 bucket. This means that all TIC 3.0 compliant logs collected in Azure are transmitted to a CISA owned Amazon S3 bucket. This solution supports that storage destination. When an Azure-based CISA owned storage option is available, this solution will update to support saving TIC 3.0 compliant logs to the Azure storage destination.

## Architecture

Architecture solutions are defined by two categories, Azure Firewall and third-party firewalls. Azure Firewall is natively configured to send logs to a Log Analytics workspace while third-party firewalls typically send logs to a Log Analytics workspace using the vendors' syslog export feature. For the purpose of this guide, the Palo Alto network virtual appliance (NVA), running in Azure, will be used for the tutorial on how to export logs in syslog format to the Log Analytics workspace.

### Components

#### Firewall

1. Firewall
   - This can be a native Azure Firewall or a third-party firewall appliance.
   - The firewall will enforce policies, collect metrics, and log connection transactions between users and services accessing the web services.
   - Firewall policy premium is utilized as it provides Intrusion Detection and Prevent System (IDPS) capabilities.
2. Firewall Logs
   - The Azure Firewall will send logs using Azure Diagnostic settings to an Azure Log Analytics workspace.
   - Third-party firewalls will send logs in syslog format to the Azure Log Analytics workspace.
3. Log Analytics Workspace
   - Repository for the collection of logs.
   - Provides a service for the organization to perform their own analysis on the network traffic along side its delivery to the CLAW.
4. Azure Automation
   - Executes every 60 minutes and queries Log Analytics workspace for Azure Firewall traffic and IDPS logs that were generated over the last 60 minutes.
   - Collected logs are uploaded to CLAW.
   - Leverages encrypted variables component of Azure Automation to store values for the runbook to  connect to the Log Analytics workspace and the CLAW storage.
5. Cloud Log Aggregation Warehouse (CLAW)
   - Supports AWS S3 bucket.
   - Requires coordination with CISA.
6. Azure Active Directory (AD)
   - Access and sign-in logs can be sent to the Log Analytics workspace using Azure Diagnostic settings in Azure AD.
7. Application Gateway, with access and web application firewall logs flowing to the shared Log Analytics workspace.
8. Load Balancer, with logs flowing to the shared Log Analytics workspace.
9. Network Security Groups, with logs flowing to the shared Log Analytics workspace.

### Alternatives

Instead of using an Automation Account to query Log Analytics workspace, format the data into JSON, and upload it to the S3 bucket, the organization could develop their own Azure Function to perform the same task. This may be useful for an organization with software developers integrated into operations and are more familiar with developer languages or are heavily utilizing Azure Functions today.

## Considerations

### Availability

### Operational excellence

- [Azure Alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview)  is built into the solution to notify the organization when an upload fails to deliver logs to the CLAW. It is up to the organization to determine the severity of this alert and how to respond. 
- Use ARM templates to speed up the deployment of additional TIC 3.0 architectures for new applications. 

### Performance

- Azure Firewall [performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/firewall-performance) scales as usage increases. If additional performance is required , Azure Premium provides performance boost which increases single TCP connections and max bandwidth.

### Reliability

- Azure Firewall Standard and Premium integrate with availability zones to increase service level agreement percentages.
- Utilize regional services paired with load balancing services like Front Door to improve reliability and resiliency.

### Security

- Registering enterprise applications creates a service principle, follow naming schemes to quickly understand the purpose of your service principles.
- Perform audits to determine activity of service principles and status of service principle owners.
- Azure Firewall has standard policies, start with those and build organization policies over time based on industry requirements, best practices, and government regulations.

## Deploy this scenario

### Requirements for all solutions

For step by step details visit [Prerequisite tasks](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection/tree/main/Architecture/Prerequisite%20Tasks)

You must have the following before deployment:

- Resource Group.
- Register an application.
- Create secret for a registered application.

Though you can deploy all of the Azure resources, to actually send log data to a CISA CLAW to support the TIC 3.0 compliance you will need the following: 

- Request CISA provide S3 bucket access key, secret, S3 bucket name, and network line-of-sight.
- Collect Tenant ID.

### Post deployment tasks for all solutions

For step by step details visit [Post deployment](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection/tree/main/Architecture/Post%20Deployment%20Tasks) tasks

The following needs to be performed once deployment is complete. These are the tasks that an ARM template cannot perform and requires some manual effort. 

- Register an application with reader role to Log Analytics workspace.
- Link schedule to runbook.
- Update Automation account variables.
