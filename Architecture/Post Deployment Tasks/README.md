# Post-deployment tasks

This repo supports an article on the Azure Architecture Center (AAC) - [Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 compliance - Azure Example Scenarios | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/security/trusted-internet-connections), it contains lots of great information on using the content of this repo. Please visit the article in the AAC before proceeding.

Up to now your environment is performing the firewall capabilities and logging connections. To be TIC 3.0 compliant for Network Telemetry collection, those logs must make it to CISA CLAW. The post-deployment steps finish the tasks towards compliance. These steps require coordination with CISA because you will need a certificate from CISA to associate with your Service Principle. 

The following tasks must be performed after deployment is complete. They are manual tasksâ€”an ARM template can't do them.

- Obtain a public key certificate from CISA. 
- Create a Service Principle (App Registration).
- Add the CISA-provided certificate to the App Registration.
- Assign the application with the Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver role to the Event Hub Namespace.

## Detailed Steps

### Obtain a public key certificate from CISA.
